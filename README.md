# Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to the **Competitive Programming Solutions** repository! This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems from platforms like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into different directories based on the platform the problem was sourced from:


### Codeforces Directory
This folder contains solutions to problems solved on the Codeforces platform. Each file is named according to the problem ID or title for easier reference.

### LeetCode Directory
This folder contains solutions to problems solved on the LeetCode platform. Each file follows a similar naming convention for easy identification of the problem.

## Getting Started

To explore the solution files, simply navigate into the corresponding platform directory and open the files. The solutions are implemented in various programming languages like:

- C++
- Python
